# Company Budget Allocation App

This project is a final assignment from the IBM Full Stack Development Course. Itâ€™s a company budget allocation application built with React and Redux. This is my second time using Redux for state management in a React application.

## Description

The Company Budget Allocation App is designed to help companies manage their departmental budgets effectively. Companies can set their overall budget and allocate funds to different departments. The app provides a visual representation of the budget and allocations, making it easier for companies to understand their financial distribution.

This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. For state management, the app uses Redux.
